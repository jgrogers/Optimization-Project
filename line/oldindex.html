These are the function and gradient evaluation subroutines
for a particular function called the Rosenbrock function. Both
take two arguments: (1) the dimension n of the input column vector;
(2) the input column vector.

These are the generic function and gradient evaluation subroutines.
Both take three arguments: (1) the dimension n of the input column vector;
(2) the input column vector; (3) the problem number (which references
a list of problems stored in func.m and grad.m).
<BR><BR>
For example, func1.m and grad1.m are defined as problem 1 in func.m
and grad.m. So the call func(n, x, 1) will return func1(n, x). This
provides a way of accessing different problem examples without
directly editing the algorithm or linesearch code to reflect the
specific choice of problem.

These files constitute the linesearch subroutine, with
linesearch.m being the routine called directly by the user.
This linesearch subroutine is appropriate for a minimization problem, not a
maximization problem. Its format is
<CENTER><PRE>[retcode, ax, af, ag, alpha] = linesearch(n, x, f, g, dir, initalpha, prob);</PRE></CENTER>
where (a) the inputs are n (the problem dimension), x (the input column vector),
f (the function value at x), g (the gradient at x),
dir (the direction of movement), initalpha (the initial
choice of stepsize) and prob (the problem number) and where (b)
the outputs are retcode (the subroutine return code), ax (the
new solution vector), af (the function value at ax), ag (the gradient
at ax) and alpha (the stepsize chosen by the linesearch algorithm).
<BR><BR>
If the return code is -1, then the linesearch has failed, and its
output should be ignored.
<BR><BR>
Please let me know if you find any bugs in this subroutine.

This is a steepest descent method which combines all of the
above files. Put all the files in your Matlab working directory
and try
<CENTER><PRE>[optsoln, optval] = stdesc(4, [0; 0; 0; 0], 500, 1);</PRE></CENTER>
at the Matlab command line. Here, 4 is the problem dimension,
[0; 0; 0; 0] is the initial starting point, 500 is the number
of iterations and 1 is the problem type.

This is a .tar file containing linesearch subroutines. You will have
to find out by yourself how it works!
